# vanillaJS-dropdownMenu
 A custom select dropdown built using JavaScript

## Description
This custom select dropdown provides a more visually appealing and customizable alternative to the default `<select>` element in HTML. It is built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Vanilla JavaScript. It provides a cleaner, fully customasable and more maintainable approach to creating reusable code components. The use of classes encapsulates the behavior and data associated with the custom select dropdown, making it easier to manipulate and interact with. 

Interactive keyboard functionality enhances the dropdown component for better user experience. Users can now navigate the dropdown options using keyboard keys such as Space, Arrow keys, Enter, and Escape. 

Pressing the Space key toggles the visibility of the dropdown options list.

The Arrow keys allow users to navigate up and down the options list.

Enter key selects an option or closes the dropdown, while Escape key closes the dropdown.

Additionally, users can type characters to search for a specific option within the dropdown. The search functionality dynamically filters the options based on the typed characters, providing a quick and efficient way to find and select an option.
