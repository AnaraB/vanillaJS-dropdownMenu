# vanillaJS-dropdownMenu
 A custom select dropdown built using JavaScript

## Description
This custom select dropdown provides a more visually appealing and customizable alternative to the default `<select>` element in HTML. It is built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Vanilla JavaScript. It provides a cleaner, fully customasable and more maintainable approach to creating reusable code components. The use of classes encapsulates the behavior and data associated with the custom select dropdown, making it easier to understand and customise.
